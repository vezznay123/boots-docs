**Priority**: High

## Overview

Headings are crucial for structuring content within articles, particularly in content hubs where users seek well-organised information. Proper use of heading tags not only aids user navigation but also helps search engines better understand the context of the content. Following a hierarchical heading structure ensures both readability and effective SEO.

## Heading Guidelines

### 1. H1 Heading Tag

- **Unique Usage**: Only one H1 tag should be used per article.
- **Article Title**: The H1 should clearly identify the article using its name, which can be dynamically retrieved from the CMS or API.
- **Placement**: Typically used as the main page title, placed prominently at the top of the page or to the side as part of a content listing.

### 2. H2 Heading Tags

- **Multiple Allowed**: Use multiple H2 tags to organise content into sections.
- **Section Headings**: Clearly label each section to indicate its theme (e.g., "Category Name"), making it easy for readers to scan the content.

### 3. H3 and Other Sub-Heading Tags

- **Nested Structure**: Use H3 tags under H2 headings to further break down sections when additional detail is needed.
- **Specific Details**: Use H3s and lower-level subheadings to provide more detailed information within each section.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Clear Hierarchy**: Maintain a clear heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to improve readability and aid user navigation.
2. **SEO-Friendly Structure**: Headings help search engines understand the content structure; use meaningful keywords in headings for better SEO performance.
3. **Descriptive Headings**: Ensure each heading clearly describes the content of the section it represents, giving users context at a glance.
4. **Avoid Overuse**: Avoid overusing heading tags, particularly H1, to prevent confusing both readers and search engines.

## Conclusion

Proper heading use is vital for content hubs, particularly for content articles that need to convey structured and meaningful information. By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure both a better user experience and improved SEO results, making your content easier to navigate and more appealing to users and search engines alike.
