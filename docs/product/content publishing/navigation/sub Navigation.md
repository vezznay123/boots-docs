**Priority**: High

## Overview

Sub-navigation helps users explore specific content areas within an article editorial resource. This is especially useful when dealing with a large number of content categories or sections. Implementing an effective sub-navigation solution for editorial content ensures that users can easily locate and navigate through relevant articles while differentiating it from the main global navigation. 

**Menu Content**: Populate each section menu with relevant subcategories, topics, or filters tailored to the specific editorial section's content, such as 'Health Tips', 'Product Reviews', or 'DIY Guides', ensuring users can quickly navigate within the article resource.

**Distinct Styling**: Clearly differentiate the sub-navigation menu from the global navigation using different styling, such as unique colours, fonts, or visual separators (e.g., borders or background shading).

### Mobile

- **Hamburger Menu**: Replace the section-specific sub-navigation with a collapsible hamburger menu icon, positioned beneath the global navigation bar, to conserve screen space.
- **Menu Structure**:
  - The hamburger menu should include links to all main editorial categories.
  - Incorporate a search bar within the menu, allowing users to search the article database directly.
- **Collapsible Design**: The collapsible nature of the hamburger menu ensures that it remains unobtrusive while still being accessible to users.

### Clear Labelling

- **Concise Labels**: Ensure clear and concise labelling for all menu items and sections within both the desktop sub-navigation and mobile hamburger menu.
- **User Clarity**: Labels should make it immediately clear what content the link leads to, reducing confusion and enhancing usability.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Desktop & Mobile Consistency**: Ensure the sub-navigation menus provide a consistent navigation experience across desktop and mobile devices, while using device-specific designs. For desktop, this could include larger, horizontal sub-navigation bars, while mobile designs might involve collapsible, vertical menus to optimise space.
2. **Differentiation**: Differentiate sub-navigation menus from the main global navigation to reduce confusion and create a clear content hierarchy.
3. **Search Integration**: Include a search bar within the mobile sub-navigation menu to help users locate specific articles more efficiently.
4. **Accessible Design**: Ensure that sub-navigation elements are accessible and easy to interact with, regardless of the device used.

## Conclusion

Integrating effective sub-navigation menus for both desktop and mobile users significantly enhances usability, ensuring users can locate the content they need with ease. By following these guidelines, you ensure that sub-navigation is intuitive, differentiated, and suitable for users across all devices.
