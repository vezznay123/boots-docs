**Priority**: High

## Overview

The sidebar sub-navigation helps users explore L1 subcategories within a given content category, allowing them to quickly navigate across related content sections. Implementing effective sidebar sub-navigation is particularly important for enhancing the user experience on content-heavy landing pages and ensuring users can discover all available resources effortlessly.

## Desktop Implementation

- **Sidebar Sub-Navigation**: The sidebar sub-navigation should be displayed on all content landing pages, showcasing L1 subcategories related to the main L1 category being explored.
- **Section-Specific Navigation**: The sidebar should be specific to the category being viewed, allowing users to explore subcategories without leaving the current context.
- **Link Management**: Enable web managers to add, remove, and edit linking anchors and headings that connect to subcategory listing pages.
- **Reordering Capability**: Provide an option to reorder listings and headings within the sub-navigation menu, allowing for the optimisation of the user navigation experience.

## Mobile Implementation

- **Collapsible Hamburger Menu**: On mobile devices, the subcategory tree should be expanded within the collapsible hamburger menu. This ensures that sub-navigation elements are accessible while conserving valuable screen space.
- **Menu Structure**: Maintain clear separation between the global navigation and the sub-navigation by incorporating distinct sections for each. The subcategory links should be organised and easy to navigate within the collapsible menu.

## Requirements

### 1. Link Management
- **Addition, Removal, Editing**: Enable the addition, removal, and editing of linking anchors and headings that connect to subcategory listing pages to provide flexibility for content managers.

### 2. Reordering Capability
- **Optimising User Navigation**: Allow the reordering of listings and headings within the sub-navigation menu to optimise the user experience and promote frequently accessed categories.

### 3. Validation
- **Item Limits**: Set restrictions on the number of parent navigation labels, category listings, and subcategory listings to prevent overcrowding and maintain usability, pending the final design and styling of both the global and content hub navigation.
- **Category Monitoring**: Automatically remove categories from the sidebar that are no longer active or do not contain content, to avoid broken or misleading links. These issues should be flagged within the platform to alert web managers of potential navigation errors.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Desktop vs. Mobile**: Provide consistent navigation by using an always-visible sidebar for desktop users and a collapsible menu for mobile users.
2. **Flexibility for Content Managers**: Allow easy link management and reordering, giving content managers full control over how categories are displayed.
3. **Overcrowding Prevention**: Limit the number of subcategories shown to prevent clutter and improve overall user experience.
4. **Automated Monitoring**: Implement automated monitoring for inactive categories to keep navigation clean and error-free.

## Conclusion

A well-implemented sidebar sub-navigation structure helps users to seamlessly navigate through content sections, providing them with an intuitive way to explore related subcategories. By following these guidelines, you ensure that both desktop and mobile users enjoy an efficient and user-friendly navigation experience, tailored to suit the needs of your content hub.
